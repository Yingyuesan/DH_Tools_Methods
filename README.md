1.Specify a topic on which you'd like to work in the following weeks: Predict students' dropout.

2.Provide some context for the topic, citing existing research (theoretical, interpretative, and/or empirical) that makes some testable claims: Student dropout is a critical factor in the education system that have long been studied by researchers. Dropout rates have significant negative consequences, including lost educational opportunities, decreased earning potential, and an increased likelihood of unemployment. In a study "Predicting students at risk of dropping out using administrative data: Case of primary and secondary schools in China" by Zhang and Zhou (2019), the researchers developed a predictive model to identify at-risk students in primary and secondary schools in China. The model incorporated a range of factors, including academic performance, behavior, and socio-economic status, and was found to be effective in predicting students at risk of dropping out.

3.Formulate at least one research question (RQ) and/or hypothesis: Whether poverty has significant implications for educational outcomes.

4.Explaining how you think you can explore the proposed topic and address the RQs: Firstly, analyzing existing data sets, such as census data, education surveys, or administrative data to calculate the dropout rate of students in poverty. Secondly, conducting case studies of schools or educational programs that serve low-income communities. Finally, The findings of the study would be interpreted and analyzed to provide insights into the relationship between poverty and educational outcomes.

5.Describe what kind of data you need to answer your RQs and/or test your hypothesis: Analyzing existing data sets, such as census data, education surveys, and administrative data from schools or educational institutions, for instance, e.g. information on the demographics of low-income students, their academic performance, attendance rates etc.
